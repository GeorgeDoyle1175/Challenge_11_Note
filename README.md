# Note Taking App
This is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to take and save notes. The application uses a RESTful API to store notes on a server, which can then be retrieved and displayed on the client-side.

# Technologies used
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* HTML
* CSS

# Functionality
When the user opens the application, they are presented with a blank note-taking interface. They can then enter a note title and note text, and click the save button to save the note to the server. The saved note is displayed in a list on the left side of the screen, and the user can click on any note in the list to view or edit it.

Users can also delete a note by clicking on the trash icon next to the note in the list. To create a new note, the user can click on the "New Note" button.
